    <h1>New Relic Ruby Kata</h1>
    <p>Code Kata is a term coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=020161622X&linkCode=as2&tag=alveleschpta-20">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> in a nod to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.</p>
    <p>The goal of this Kata is to get your mind wired into performance driven development, to reinforce your skills as a user of <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> and to help you get more familiar with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
    <p>Of course the code in some areas of this application is intentionally bad, but what fun would this be if everything worked the way it should?</p>

      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <p>Get the code. Using your <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> account, fork the <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-kata">newrelic/newrelic-ruby-kata</a> repo and then clone it onto your machine.</p>
    <p><a class="btn" href="https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-kata/" target="_blank">Fork &amp; Clone! &raquo;</a></p>
 	</div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <p>You should have an Amazon EC2 instance up and running (<a href="https://source.datanerd.us/engineering-training/newb-relic/blob/main-project-as-team/exercises/main-project/aws_environment.md" target="_blank">understand and set up the AWS EC2 instance</a>).</p>
      <p>Connect to your EC2 instance with SSH. Create a directory for your team and clone your team's fork of the repo using these commands:</p>
      <pre>cd && mkdir team-name
git clone https://github.com/[githubusername]/newrelic-ruby-kata.git
cd newrelic-ruby-kata</pre>
      <p>(You'll want to change "team-name" to your team name, and "[githubusername]" to the GitHub username of the person who cloned your repo.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      <p>Now you can load the sample data from the root directory of your application via:</p>
      <pre>bundle exec rake db:create
pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U $USER -d newrelic-ruby-kata_development public/sample-data.dump</pre>
      <p>You're ready to run the application!</p>
      <pre>rails server -b 0.0.0.0</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Step 4</h2>
      <p>You can watch a <a href="https://learn.newrelic.com/courses/intro_apm/performance_apm">video on getting started</a> with the New Relic agent to help get you started. The New Relic agent will help you find and solve the performance issues in this application as well as help you see the complete impact of your changes.

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Step 5</h2>
      <p>Fix the code / Solve as many of the Katas as you can. There are seven<!-- TODO --> distinct Katas in this application that can be torn apart and fixed by using your awesome dev abilities and the deep metrics that New Relic provides.</p>
      <p>
        <ol>
      		<li>Generate traffic a.k.a. click around</li>
      		<li>Discover a slow page</li>
      		<li>Investigate the problem (using New Relic)</li>
      		<li>Resolve with code changes</li>
      		<li>
            Push the revised code to your GitHub repo and then pull (using "git pull") from the root of your application on your EC2 instance.
            <br>
            <em style="margin-left: 1em;">Repeat...</em>
          </li>
